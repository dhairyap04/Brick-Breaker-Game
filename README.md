# Brick-Breaker-Game
## The Program

The program is simply the well-known game called Brick Breaker. After running the program, a starting screen will pop up asking you to press space to begin the game. The objective of the game is to break all the blocks presented on the screen with the use of the ball. If the ball touches the floor instead of the paddle, a life will be deducted. When you reach 0 lives, the game will end and prompt you to press the space bar to play again. If you need to exit, simply click the X button on the window of the game. 

## Planning

The hardest aspect of planning this program was the collisions between the blocks and the ball. They took a good chunk of time to code in as there were multiple ways the ball could bounce upon contact with the block. 

## Special Feature

The main special feature that I added in my program would be players having 3 lives throughout the game so beginners and newbies can continue playing even after making a couple mistakes without having to start over every time. 

Another special feature that is included is that the game does not end as long as the user does not lose. The levels are placed in a loop and keep on going with increasing difficulty. How high of a score the user gets is based upon their skill only, with no other restrictions in the game.
